This a robotics project where the aim is to create a simple robotic base that is modular, such that we can experiment with different:
1. sensor suites  
2. compute hardware like arduino, pico, etc.  
3. Motor drivers

The base is 3d printed. The motors being used are n20 motors with quad encoders. Motor driver is a l298n. Microcontroller is arduino uno. 

Aim of the project is to learn and experiment on this platform to gain more knowledge and do quick PoCs.

ROS2 is also something that the project will tackle in the future.
